# **The little florist school**

Based on a fictional business offering floral arrangement classes, this website was built for educational purposes as part of the Code Institute's Full Stack Development course. This fully responsive and user centric website was designed using the principles of User Experience Design and developed using HTLM, CSS and bootstrap framework.

### **Structure**
*(try to link to user story)*

*Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.*

*In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:*

*As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.*
*This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser*

### **Design**

#### Fonts
*Primary font - explain choice* 
*Secondary font - explain choice - complement primary font / impact*
#### Icons
*Explain choice - font awesome* 
#### Colour scheme
*Explain choice - how they chosen? Color picker? Palette?*
*Go for contrast*
#### Styling
*Explain if you applied a particular style of styling for particular reason - ex using rounded corners because it's more child friendly*
#### Imagery
*Background-image/hero image/carousel/other*
*explain your choice - eg it illustrate what type of flower arrangement could be achieved in the course and illustrate the purpose the courses / appealing image sell experience customers can expect form the course*
#### Wireframes
*Desktop | Mobile | Tablet*
*Include links* 
*Explain software used and which wireframes are provided*
The wireframes displayed below were created using Balsamic during the skeleton plane of the project and illustrates how the website will be structured across different devices and screen widths.
You will find the link below should the images do not display properly. 
#### Differences to design

#### Limitations


# Features

### **Existing Features**
*Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z*
...
*For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.*

*In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:*
*Example nav bar / homepage / footer / contact form / location map*

### **Features left to implement**


# Technologies used
*In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.*

*JQuery*
*The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.*

HTML
CSS
Bootstrap

*Testing & Deployment should be done towards the end of coding project*
# Testing
*In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.*

*Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.*

*For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:*

*Contact form:*
*Go to the "Contact Us" page*
*Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears*
*Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears*
*Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.*
*In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.*

*You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.*

*If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.*

### **Scope** 
*Different browser/layout/links/navigation/image rendered*
*Most common path Home/courses/book*

### **Test validation criteria**
*Testing user stories*
*w3c html validation*
*w3c css validation*
*google inspect*

### **Test results**
*table with bugs and debugs*

### **Issues and resolutions**


# Deployment

*In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:*

*Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?*
*Different configuration files?*
*Separate git branch?*
*In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.*

### **Project inception**
*ex This project was developed using Gitpod, committed to git then pushed onto GitHub using the built-in function withing Gitpod.*
*Updates were committed frequently to git and the project pushed onto GitHub on a regular basis to make sure it was saved properly*

*Explain the process of deploying the project on GitHub from Login to publishing a note*
*Indicate the branch on which the site was deployed*
