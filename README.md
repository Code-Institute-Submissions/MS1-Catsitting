# **Katsit London - Cat sitting agency in London **

Based on a fictional business offering cat sitting services, this website was built for educational purposes as part of the Code Institute's Full Stack Development course. This fully responsive and user centric website was designed using the principles of User Experience Design and developed using HTLM, CSS and bootstrap framework.

Katsit London is a cat sitting company set up by a former veterinary nurse, who has extensive knowledge and experience in caring for animals with an already formidable reputation for cat-sitting.
 
Katsit London is fast expanding and has recruited additional cat sitters from a trusted network of animal carers to face an increasing demand. The company now needs a responsive website to create an online presence and to advertise their services.

You can download the pdf version of the wireframes should the images not display properly.

# Design

#### Imagery

The hero image on the homepage - featuring a cat lying next to a home plant - helps to illustrate the purpose of the business. 
The image was sourced from Pexels. 

![Homepage hero image](assets/images/cat_hero.jpg)

All images on the website are featuring cats and were sourced from Pexels. Please find using the link below the full list of credits. 

#### Colour scheme

The colour palette was created using Adobe Color and the hero image from the homepage.

![Colour palette light](documentation/design/colourpalette1.jpeg)
![Colour palette dark](documentation/design/colourpalette2.jpeg)

The following colours from the palette are used across the website and have been selected for their contrast whilst keeping in harmony with the main image.

- ... is used for both header and footer.
- ... is used for all text on light background and also for some section panels to add contrast.
- ... is used for headers, icons, buttons and horizontal lines when on light background.
- ... is used for text, icons and buttons on dark background. 


#### Fonts

The website uses Open Sans as primary font, whilst the headings and subheadings uses the secondary font Poppin, which pairs nicely with Open Sans. 
Both fonts were sourced from Google fonts and were selected for their round edges, which add softness to the website.  

#### Icons

Icons from the Font Awesome library are used across the website to illustrate and hihglight some text and headings. 

#### Styling
*Explain if you applied a particular style of styling for particular reason - ex using rounded corners because it's more child friendly*

# Testing

*Testing & Deployment should be done towards the end of coding project*

*In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.*

*Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.*

*For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:*

*Contact form:*
*Go to the "Contact Us" page*
*Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears*
*Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears*
*Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.*
*In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.*

*You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.*

*If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.*

### **Scope** 
*Different browser/layout/links/navigation/image rendered*
*Most common path Home/courses/book*

### **Test validation criteria**
*Testing user stories*
*w3c html validation*
*w3c css validation*
*google inspect*

### **Test results**
*table with bugs and debugs*

### **Issues and resolutions**

*Different configuration files?*
*Separate git branch?*
*In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.*

*Explain the process of deploying the project on GitHub from Login to publishing a note*
