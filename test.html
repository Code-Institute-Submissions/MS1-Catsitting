  <h5>Alex Jones</h5>
                <p class="testimonial-text">We were a bit anxious to leave our kittens for the first time whilst going on holiday this summer
                    and Rebecca from Snuggle Cats provided all the reinsurance we needed. We received regular videos of
                    Merlin
                    and Sasha playing and purring. We will definitively use Snuggle Cats again for our next holiday.</p>
