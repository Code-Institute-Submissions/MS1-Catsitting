# **The little florist school**

Based on a fictional business offering cat sitting services, this website was built for educational purposes as part of the Code Institute's Full Stack Development course. This fully responsive and user centric website was designed using the principles of User Experience Design and developed using HTLM, CSS and bootstrap framework.

# Features

### **Existing Features**
*Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z*
...
*For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.*

*In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:*
*Example nav bar / homepage / footer / contact form / location map*

### **Features left to implement**


# Technologies used
*In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.*

*JQuery*
*The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.*

HTML
CSS
Bootstrap

*Testing & Deployment should be done towards the end of coding project*
# Testing
*In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.*

*Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.*

*For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:*

*Contact form:*
*Go to the "Contact Us" page*
*Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears*
*Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears*
*Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.*
*In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.*

*You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.*

*If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.*
