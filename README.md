- ## **Wireframes**

    The wireframes were created using Balsamic during the skeleton plane of the project and illustrates the structure of the website across different devices.

    You can either view the wireframe [here](documentation/wireframes/wireframes.png) (in png format) or [download](https://a45c73f1-3de6-45f3-bdf8-7fdbe308ac5f.ws-eu03.gitpod.io/files/download/?id=bdb7e86e-0825-49b6-a2f7-0cc69646e029) the pdf version of the wireframes should the images not display properly. 
    [download pdf wireframes]

    ### **Differences to wireframes** 
 
     - In the very early inception of the project (early commits, then removed), the wireframes indicated a three page website, this was quickly changed to a single page website as the project was redefined for a more balanced and eye-catching design with adjustment to UX design.
     - The contact button in the footer doesn’t feature in the final version of the website, as the contact form is close to the footer. 
     - Background images were not used in the contact section as they interfered with, rather than enhanced, the visibility of the contact form.  


- ## **Design**

  - ### **Imagery**
    
    All images on the website have the purpose to either illustrate or highlight the content on display:
     
     - The logo, a cat icon sourced from Shutterstock, features in the header and in browsers to help with brand recognition. For better visibility the favicon is in a dark colour as opposed to the white logo in the navigation. 
     - The hero image on top of the page has for main objectives to grab the user’s attention and to help create an instant connection with the service offered by the business. 
     - The service section uses background images of cats as a way to highlight the text by creating a striking contrast.
     - The testimonial section features images of customers to increase credibility of their recommendations.
 
    Please find using the full [list of credits](#media) below.
 
  - ### **Colour scheme**
  
    The following colours have been selected for their contrast whilst giving a soft yet modern feel to the website in harmony with the main hero image. This colour palette was created using the Google inspect colour picker and further research from [color-hex](https://color-hex.org/color/b06a23).  

    ![Colour palette](documentation/design/colourfinal.jpeg)  

     - Dark #262221 is used for text including headings, header and footer background (colour picked).  
     - Brown #B06A23 is used for horizontal lines on light background and hover effect on buttons (color-picked).  
     - White #F8f7F6 is used for white background and on dark background (tint of #BFB6AE).  
     - Beige #BFB6AE is used for light background to create contrast between sections of the website (color picked).  
     - Green #23B06A is used for the buttons (triadic colour of #B06A23).  
 
  - ### **Fonts**
 
     The website uses Open Sans as primary font, whilst the headings and subheadings use the secondary font Poppins, which pairs nicely with Open Sans.
     Both fonts were sourced from Google fonts and were selected for their round edges, which add softness to the website. 
 
  - ### **Icons**
 
     Icons from the Font Awesome library are used to bring attention to contact details and social media accounts. Icons will also be used to add style to the list of services offered.
 
  - ### **Styling**
 
     - Buttons and some text boxes have slightly rounded corners to add a softer feeling and make these elements more noticeable whilst improving user experience on the website.  
     - Credentials information are presented in a circular block to draw the eye to the uniqueness of these elements and breathe life into this section of the website.  
     - Testimonials images are also circular for a more appealing design whilst giving breathing space to the testimonial section.  


  - ### **Differences to design**

    - An initial hero image was tested but did not fulfil the desired visual impact, as it would not resize and accommodate the call for action in an appealing way.  
    - An initial palette was created using Adobe Color however the colour did not render as well as on screen, therefore different choices were made and the palette was finalised more towards the end for better and striking visual impact.  
    - The Green #23B06A was replaced with #078847 to fit accessibility contrast requirements.


- # **Features** 

- ## **Existing features**   
      
    - Responsive design to allow user to browse the website on all devices

    - An embedded map showing the areas covered by the business with search and zoom option so that users can quickly see if the business operates where they live.  
    - Form with validation control to allow users to make contact with the business.  
    - Clickable and hoverable icons to allow users to open social media links into new tabs, whilst retaining navigation on the website.   

- ## **Features left to implement**  

    - GDPR compliant cookie policy via a banner when users first visit the website.    
    - Link the form to a webserver to collect data entered.   
    - A blog to build relationships with current and potential customers, adding further credibility to the business.
